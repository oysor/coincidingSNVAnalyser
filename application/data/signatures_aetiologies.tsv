Signature_ID	Cancer_types	Proposed_aetiology	Comments
S1	All cancer types	Endogenous mutational process initiated by spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine, correlates with aging.	NA
S2	22 cancer types, most commonly in cervical and bladder cancers (usually in > 10% of samples)	Activity of AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases (APOBEC1, APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B)	S2 is usually found in the same samples as S13. It has been proposed that activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases is due to viral infection, retrotransposon jumping or to tissue inflammation. Currently, there is limited evidence to support these hypotheses. A germline deletion polymorphism involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B is associated with the presence of large numbers of S2 and S13 mutations and with predisposition to breast cancer. Mutations of similar patterns to S2 and S13 are commonly found in the phenomenon of local hypermutation present in some cancers, known as kataegis, potentially implicating AID/APOBEC enzymes in this process as well.
S3	Breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers	Associated with failure of DNA double-strand break-repair by homologous recombination	Strongly associated with germline and somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. In pancreatic cancer, responders to platinum therapy usually exhibit S3 mutations
S4	Head and neck cancer, liver cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, oesophageal cancer	Associated with smoking and its profile is similar to the mutational pattern observed in experimental systems exposed to tobacco carcinogens (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene). S4 is likely due to tobacco mutagens	S29 is found in cancers associated with tobacco chewing and appears different from S4
S5	All cancer types	Unknown	Exhibits transcriptional strand bias for T>C substitutions at ApTpN context
S6	17 cancer types, most common in colorectal and uterine cancers (usually in < 3% of samples)	Associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and is found in microsatellite unstable tumours	S6 is one of four mutational signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and is often found in the same samples as S15, S20, S26
S7	Predominantly in skin cancers and in cancers of the lip categorized as head and neck or oral squamous cancers	Based on its prevalence in ultraviolet exposed areas and the similarity of the mutational pattern to that observed in experimental systems exposed to ultraviolet light S7 is likely due to ultraviolet light exposure	Signature 7 is associated with large numbers of CC>TT dinucleotide mutations at dipyrimidines. Additionally, Signature 7 exhibits a strong transcriptional strand-bias indicating that mutations occur at pyrimidines (viz., by formation of pyrimidine-pyrimidine photodimers) and these mutations are being repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair.
S8	S8 has been found in breast cancer and medulloblastoma	Unknown	S8 exhibits weak strand bias for C>A substitutions and is associated with double nucleotide substitutions, notably CC>AA
S9	S9 has been found in chronic lymphocytic leukaemias and malignant B-cell lymphomas	S9 is characterized by a pattern of mutations that has been attributed to polymerase Î·, which is implicated with the activity of AID during somatic hypermutation	Chronic lymphocytic leukaemias that possess immunoglobulin gene hypermutation (IGHV-mutated) have elevated numbers of mutations attributed to S9 compared to those that do not have immunoglobulin gene hypermutation
S10	Found in six cancer types, notably colorectal and uterine cancer, usually generating huge numbers of mutations in small subsets of samples	It has been proposed that the mutational process underlying this signature is altered activity of the error-prone polymerase POLE. The presence of large numbers of S10 mutations is associated with recurrent POLE somatic mutations, viz., Pro286Arg and Val411Leu	S10 exhibits strand bias for C>A mutations at TpCpT context and T>G mutations at TpTpT context
S11	Melanoma and glioblastoma	S11 exhibits a mutational pattern resembling that of alkylating agents. Patient histories have revealed an association between treatments with the alkylating agent temozolomide and S11 mutations	S11 exhibits a strong transcriptional strand-bias for C>T substitutions indicating that mutations occur on guanine and that these mutations are effectively repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair
S12	Liver cancer	Unknown	Strong transcriptional strand-bias for T>C substitutions (contributes a small percentage (< 20%) of mutations observed in a liver cancer sample)
S13	22 cancer tyeps, most common in cervical and bladder cancers (usually in > 10% of samples)	S13 has been attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases converting cytosine to uracil. On the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems, a role for APOBEC1, APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B in human cancer appears more likely than for other members of the family. Signature 13 causes predominantly C>G mutations. This may be due to generation of abasic sites after removal of uracil by base excision repair and replication over these abasic sites by REV1	S2 is usually found in the same samples as S13. It has been proposed that activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases is due to viral infection, retrotransposon jumping or to tissue inflammation. Currently, there is limited evidence to support these hypotheses. A germline deletion polymorphism involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B is associated with the presence of large numbers of S2 and S13 mutations and with predisposition to breast cancer. Mutations of similar patterns to S2 and S13 are commonly found in the phenomenon of local hypermutation present in some cancers, known as kataegis, potentially implicating AID/APOBEC enzymes in this process as well
S14	Four uterine cancers and a single adult low-grade glioma sample	Unknown	Generates very high numbers of somatic mutations (>200 mutations per MB) in all samples in which it has been observed
S15	Several stomach cancers and a single small cell lung carcinoma	Associated with defective DNA mismatch repair	S15 is one of four mutational signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and is often found in the same samples as S6, S20, S26
S16	Liver cancer	Unknown	Exhibits an extremely strong transcriptional strand bias for T>C mutations at ApTpN context, with T>C mutations occurring almost exclusively on the transcribed strand
S17	Oesophagus cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, stomach cancer, melanoma	Unknown	NA
S18	Neuroblastoma (some breast and stomach)	Unknown	NA

S20	Stomach and breast cancers	S20 is believed to be associated with defective DNA mismatch repair	S20 is one of four mutational signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and is often found in the same samples as S6, S15, and S26
S21	Stomach cancers	Unknown	S21 is found only in four samples all generated by the same sequencing centre. The mutational pattern of S21 is somewhat similar to the one of S26. Additionally, S21 is found only in samples that also have S15 and S20. As such, S21 is probably also related to microsatellite unstable tumours
S22	Urothelial (renal pelvis) carcinoma and liver cancers	S22 has been found in cancer samples with known exposures to aristolochic acid. Additionally, the pattern of mutations exhibited by the signature is consistent with the one previous observed in experimental systems exposed to aristolochic acid	S22 exhibits a very strong transcriptional strand bias for T>A mutations indicating adenine damage that is being repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, very high mutational burden in urothelial carcinoma; however, its mutational burden is much lower in liver cancers
S23	Single liver cancer sample	Unknown	Transcriptional strand bias for C>T mutations
S24	A subset of liver cancers	S24 has been found in cancer samples with known exposures to aflatoxin. Additionally, the pattern of mutations exhibited by the signature is consistent with that previous observed in experimental systems exposed to aflatoxin	S24 exhibits a very strong transcriptional strand bias for C>A mutations indicating guanine damage that is being repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair

S28	A subset of stomach cancers	Unknown	NA
S29	Gingivo-buccal oral squamous cell carcinoma	S29 has been found in cancer samples from individuals with a tobacco chewing habit	S29 exhibits transcriptional strand bias for C>A mutations indicating guanine damage that is most likely repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair.
